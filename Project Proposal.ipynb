    "# Main idea\n",
    "We plan to tackle *blind deconvolution.* Given a good guess of the filter function $h$ and observations of the output $g$, is it possible to recover $f$ in\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g = h\\otimes f$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "NASA faced the same thing when the Hubble mirror became flawed on launch. They even have an entire wikipedia section about the [flawed mirror]!\n",
    "\n",
    "[flawed mirror]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope#Flawed_mirror\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "When $h$ is known, we know how to deconvolve with the Weiner filter, which minimizes the MSE or can find an estimate $\\widehat{f}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{f} = \\arg \\min_f \\left|\\left|g - H f\\right|\\right|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ and $f$ have been vectorized and $H$ is the matrix representing the convolution.\n",

    "## References\n",
    "1. [Wikipedia -- Blind deconvolution]. This includes some links to academic papers; probably grok one of those.\n",
