### Meeting 2015-11-13
By 2015-11-20 reimplement Lab 4. That involves

* let's do Gaussian blur (or similar). We assume this is similar to the
  convolution seen in astronomical images. *(Scott)*
* deblurring image with *exact* knowledge of H *(Scott)*
* Meet tomorrow to have Scott explain his implementation, have Guneet/Smita
  implement below by next week
* deblurring image when H is slightly unknown *(Decided on Saturday)*

### Meeting 2015-11-30
* implement different paper (Smita)
* verify Richardson-Lucy alg is working (Scott)
* implement Richardson-Lucy on an image (Scott)
* get 1988 paper working (Gunnet)
    * with inverse, weiner
    * try better (perfect) estimate of X, H
