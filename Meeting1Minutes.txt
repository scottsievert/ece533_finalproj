Minutes of meeting on 14thNov
1 Scott made the sample program for Tikhonov regularisation - knowing the original filter
2 The following tasks need to be done
 
A. Done The code right now is implemented for square images - need to change the code so that it works 
 on any dimension image
 Alternative approach - to consider a square and a rectangle in another square image- Skip for now, not the main objective
B. Implementation of the algorithm when partial information ofH is known - say expected value of signal strength
   Example - weiner filter	
C. implementation when no information of H is known - final goal
    tv_fista_deblur 
D. Read and implement the papers shared by Prof Willett


Send the matrix to inpainting function as a column vector
